## Explore and Summarize Data using R: Red Wine Quality Dataset 

**Background**  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal, rigorous statistical analyses are applied. In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.  
  

**Objective:**  Investigate a dataset of 1599 red wines, explore 11 physicochemical properties, and determine the ones that most influenced the quality rating of the wine using statistical plots, and regression and correlation analysis.
